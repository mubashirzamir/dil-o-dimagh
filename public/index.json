[{"content":"TL;DR: Steps on how to set it up for Linux Mint Cinnamon Desktop Environment.\nProblem Statement In my most recent Obsidian obsession, I started looking for widgets - both mobile and desktop that display my notes, more specifically my DO and TODO lists. The journey has culminated into this post.\nMy proposed solution, as the title suggests, is going to be for desktop, specifically the Linux Mint Cinnamon environment. Nevertheless, I did find some interesting applications for mobile devices in my Literature Review.\nRequirements See and edit my Obsidian notes at a glance from a Cinnamon desklet Literature Review IPad \u0026amp; IPhone Widgets for Obsidian Looks promising. However, I don\u0026rsquo;t have an IPad or an IPhone, nor do I plan on getting them soon.\nAndroid Obsi Lots of great reviews. Unfortunately, the current version does not support any widgets.\nLinux Mint Zilch\u0026hellip;Looks like we\u0026rsquo;ll have to come up with our own. I\u0026rsquo;ve been recently getting my hands dirty trying to develop a Cinnamon applet anyway and this new project will look great on my pile of unfinished projects.\nFortunately, before resorting to the nuclear mindset above and diving right into development, I explored Cinnamon\u0026rsquo;s existing Note desklet by schorshii and was able to duct-tape a solution that fulfils my requirements well enough.\nTutorial Viewing \u0026amp; Editing Download and add the Note desklet by schorshii. Provide the Path to note text file as the note you want to the desklet to display. In the Command for editing this note (on mouse click) add xdg-open obsidian://open?vault=your-vault-name\u0026amp;file=your-file (You can simply get this link by right clicking any note in Obsidian and use the Copy Obsidian URL option)\nTheoretically, you can add as many such desklets as you want (I have only tested with two.) Syncing I am going to leave syncing directly from the desklet as future work. Let\u0026rsquo;s be honest - since there are 4 different syncing methods (of which I use Git), I might never get around to it.\nFor now I\u0026rsquo;ve just added Obsidian to my startup so that the notes sync on startup and set the Auto Pull Interval (minutes) to 5 under my Git plugin settings.\nLimitations Desklet does not update automatically on file change from different device The desklet does not render markdown Opens Obsidian on click - does not allow direct edits in desklet Conclusion Usually the projects I take on turn out to be a lot more complex than they seem, this was the exact opposite. I guess this is the power of open source, open standards and configurability. And yes definitely me being content with the limitations.\n","permalink":"https://dil-o-dimagh.onrender.com/posts/3.-obsidian-note-widgets-desklets-on-linux-mint/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"#tutorial\"\u003eTL;DR\u003c/a\u003e: Steps on how to set it up for Linux Mint Cinnamon Desktop Environment.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"problem-statement\"\u003eProblem Statement\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my most recent \u003ca href=\"https://obsidian.md/\"\u003eObsidian\u003c/a\u003e obsession, I started looking for widgets - both mobile and desktop that display my notes, more specifically my DO and TODO lists.

Previously, it was a 15.6\u0026quot; HP EliteBook 850 G8. Most recently it has been a 14\u0026quot; Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5.\nI am quite stubborn with introducing any additions to my workflow and setups for a number of reasons but it mainly boils down to the following mentality I have developed:\nReducing the number of dependencies both software and hardware.\nThe software part isn\u0026rsquo;t that rare for a software developer. After dealing with tons of abandoned and deprecated packages, changes to APIs, and basically everything under the sun turning into a SaaS, I\u0026rsquo;d rather stick to the bare minimum. For better or for worse, this mentality has passively also extended to hardware as well.\nHowever, during my first software engineering job as a bright-eyed developer, I caved. For the first few months, the monitor just sat there on my desk, collecting dust similar to other monitors at the desk of my colleagues. Since it was a hybrid job post COVID, a lot of them had grown accustomed to monitor-less workflows.\nOn the other hand, my project manager had always been a big proponent of a laptop + monitor setup and had been pushing me towards it since I joined. One day he sent down an ultimatum to our team - use the monitor or lose it. It was an open workspace with 6 members at each desk, there were lots of impromptu meetings and the monitors just obstructed conversations. Our desk had the better monitors and they would be much better utilised by people that well, actually utilise them. The reasoning was sound.\nIf there is one thing that irks me more than dependencies, it is things that were once freely accessible becoming inaccessible. Unknowingly, my PM had checkmated me. I converted to a laptop + monitor setup for my in-office days and I never looked back.\nThe number one thing that prevents me from making such changes is the dreaded adjustment period, where you are consciously working against your muscle memory. I am pleased to say that this transition has no such or the most minimal adjustment period that I hardly even recall now. Plus it is as plug and play as it gets, no configuration needed.\nThis was the basic setup I had:\nIDE on the bigger screen and the browser on my laptop screen (kept the browser on the smaller screen so I could do private stuff privately without fiddling around windows). For the pedantic: yes I know, technically this isn\u0026rsquo;t a dual-monitor setup but in principle it works the same.\nI am not going to elaborate further on the setup and workflows. I am assuming if you are reading this, you are tech-literate enough to know how it works. What I am going to do is to give you reasons to try it out, even with the most basic monitor you have lying around.\nIf I may appeal to the values of software engineers, it promotes separation of concerns, call it compartmentalisation, minimal context switching, or whatever term you prefer. And If you have bad eyesight or just prefer to turn the display scaling up to 150%, adding another monitor is like finally being able to breathe through your nose again after a bad flu.\n","permalink":"https://dil-o-dimagh.onrender.com/posts/2.-the-case-for-dual-monitors-by-a-stubborn-developer/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLike many developers, the main machine that I code on has always been a laptop.
